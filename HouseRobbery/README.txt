Place both folders inside your resources folder.
In server.cfg start both folders as the following

start esx_outlawalert
start Notification
start t0sic_loadingbar
start threatbar
start houseRobberies

*Note
Make sure you edit the client.lua file to the items you want to be used. Also add item "advancedlockpick" into your database.

Restart server and all should be good. If you have any question please contact me on discord ItsMaserati#5274
